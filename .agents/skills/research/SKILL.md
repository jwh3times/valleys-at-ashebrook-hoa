description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.
---

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes. In this repo that means the tracked `docs/`
   tree (`docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`, or `docs/adr/` for decisions) — **not**
   `docs/superpowers/` or `.superpowers/`, which are gitignored working areas whose files never
   get committed, and not the repo root. Private or resident-data-derived findings go under
   `private/`.
